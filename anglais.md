### Introduction :
Hello, my name is Arnaud FLORENCE and today i will present to you an article aout "The generation Millenials (1980-200)". The article was published in Time magazin on May 20,20013. It's written by Joel STEIN. I chose this article because it concerns me. I am part of this millennial's generation.

### Generation's Millenials :

the Millenials generation has 3 times more narcissistic personality disorder among 20-30 year olds than the 65 year old generation now.

more than 58% of young people in college suffer from narcissism (2009) compared to 1982. young people aged 18 to 29 dream 3 times more glory and fame but still live at home with their parents and spouses and are lazy.

Families and Work institute* reports that 80% of young people seek work with responsibilities and only 60% of them have them 10 years later.

In the 50s people took pictures for special occasions and posted them at home framed while now we all film and photograph without much use. We don't look at most of the photos/video we took. This generation forgets to enjoy the present moment and the people around it by isolating themselves and wanting to capture every moment.

Young people want to show themselves, to make themselves known and for that they show themselves doing anything to make this notice on youtube in video or instagrame in photos. There is a certain modesty and distance that is created face to face while on the internet we show our lives.

In 1970, young people were encouraged to have more self-confidence in order to have a good job and a good future. The problem is that by upsetting too much one's self-esteem one can also boost one's narcissism.


### Conclusion :

I find that we are moving towards an individualistic world and the gap is growing between people.
I'd like to end with this quote in the youtube video "you are not special":
"climb the mountain so you can see the world, not so the world can see you"
